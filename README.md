Components: Can be created in two ways:

1. Functional components
   - Functional components are also called as stateless components.
   - Component life cycle does not apply to functional components.
   - are efficient than class components.
   - states can be used in functional components using hooks.
2. Class components
   - Class components are also called as stateful components.
   - Component life cycle applies to class components.

[1:27] Functional Components are better than class components for the following reasons:

- Functional components are easier to read and test.
- Functional components help you avoid `this` keyword and the confusion around it.
- Functional components can be more easily extracted as a separate function.
- Functional components can be better optimized by React.
- Functional components are less code.
- Functional components are faster than class components.

state:

- a component's memory.
- a component's memory is used to store data.
- a component's memory is used to store data that may change over time.
- changes in state cause the component to re-render.
